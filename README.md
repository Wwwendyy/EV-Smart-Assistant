# EV Smart Range Assistant üöóüîã  
*A smart assistant app to mitigate electric vehicle (EV) mileage anxiety*  
**Status: Work in Progress üöß**

## Overview

This project aims to develop a mobile application for electric vehicle (EV) users that intelligently predicts battery range and optimizes route planning to reduce mileage anxiety. The app integrates real-time environmental and behavioral data into a predictive model that suggests the most energy-efficient routes, charging options, and driving strategies.

> üå± This project is currently in development as part of a course-based team assignment. Stay tuned for updates.

## üîç Key Features (Planned)

- **Dynamic Range Prediction**  
  Incorporates live weather, road type, traffic, battery condition, and driver behavior to estimate range more accurately than native vehicle systems.

- **Route & Charging Optimization**  
  Suggests optimal paths with charging station recommendations based on estimated consumption and availability.

- **Personalized Insights**  
  Learns from user driving patterns and tailors predictions over time.

- **Mobile-first Experience**  
  Designed for iOS and Android with a clean, intuitive UI/UX.
